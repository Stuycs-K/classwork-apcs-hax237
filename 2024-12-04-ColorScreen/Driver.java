public class Driver{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /*
    Create an 80x30 border of color (can be multiple, including different foreground/background) around your screen. It should be only 1 character thick.
    Make an array of 3 random integers, range from 0-99 inclusive
    Display the 3 integers evenly spaced (approximately) on the row below the top border.
    Depending on the values of the integers, print them in the following colors:

        under 25: bright red
        over 75: bright green
        otherwise: default to white (I am assuming your terminal background is black.)

    On the line below your random numbers, draw a horizontal separator (you can match your border's color, but use a differnet character.
    After you draw everything (including the next set of instructions), move your cursor to line 31 before your program exits, otherwise your terminal will draw over your screen.
